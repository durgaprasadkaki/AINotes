\# Artificial Intelligence – Introduction



Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence.

## Definition of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs that can think, learn, and act like humans.

## Characteristics of AI
- Ability to learn from data
- Reasoning and decision making
- Problem solving capability
- Adaptability to new situations

## Applications of AI
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Medical diagnosis systems
- Self-driving cars
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)


## Goals of Artificial Intelligence
- To create intelligent systems that can simulate human intelligence
- To enable machines to learn from experience
- To solve complex problems efficiently
- To assist humans in decision making
- To improve automation and productivity
- AI helps in automation of tasks

## Types of Artificial Intelligence

### Weak AI (Narrow AI)
Weak AI is designed to perform a specific task. It does not have general intelligence or self-awareness.

**Examples:**
- Chatbots
- Voice assistants
- Recommendation systems

### Strong AI (General AI)
Strong AI refers to machines that possess human-like intelligence and can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

**Status:**  
Strong AI is still theoretical and does not exist today.

## AI vs Human Intelligence
- AI works based on data and algorithms
- Human intelligence involves emotions and creativity
- AI is faster in computation
- Humans are better at understanding context and emotions

---

## Advantages of Artificial Intelligence
- Reduces human effort
- Improves efficiency and accuracy
- Can work continuously without fatigue
- Helps in solving complex problems

---

## Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence
- High development cost
- Lack of creativity and emotions
- Dependency on machines
- Risk of job displacement

## Intelligent Agents

An intelligent agent is an entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment using actuators in order to achieve its goals.

## Components of an Intelligent Agent
- Sensors: Used to perceive the environment
- Actuators: Used to perform actions
- Agent program: Controls the agent’s actions
- Environment: The surroundings in which the agent operates

## Types of Intelligent Agents
- Simple reflex agents
- Model-based agents
- Goal-based agents
- Utility-based agents
- Learning agents

## Examples of Intelligent Agents
- Autonomous robots
- Smart thermostats
- Self-driving cars
- Game-playing agents
## AI Problem Solving

AI problem solving is the process of finding a sequence of actions that leads from an initial state to a goal state using intelligent techniques.

## Problem Solving Steps in AI
1. Define the problem clearly
2. Identify the initial state
3. Specify the goal state
4. Determine possible actions
5. Apply search strategies to reach the solution

## Role of Heuristics in AI
A heuristic is a rule or method that helps in making decisions faster by reducing the search space.

## Importance of Problem Solving in AI
- Helps in handling complex tasks
- Reduces human effort
- Improves decision making
- Forms the foundation for search algorithms
