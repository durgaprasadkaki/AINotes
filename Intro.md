\# Artificial Intelligence – Introduction



Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence.

## Definition of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs that can think, learn, and act like humans.

## Characteristics of AI
- Ability to learn from data
- Reasoning and decision making
- Problem solving capability
- Adaptability to new situations

## Applications of AI
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Medical diagnosis systems
- Self-driving cars
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)


## Goals of Artificial Intelligence
- To create intelligent systems that can simulate human intelligence
- To enable machines to learn from experience
- To solve complex problems efficiently
- To assist humans in decision making
- To improve automation and productivity
- AI helps in automation of tasks

## Types of Artificial Intelligence

### Weak AI (Narrow AI)
Weak AI is designed to perform a specific task. It does not have general intelligence or self-awareness.

**Examples:**
- Chatbots
- Voice assistants
- Recommendation systems

### Strong AI (General AI)
Strong AI refers to machines that possess human-like intelligence and can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

**Status:**  
Strong AI is still theoretical and does not exist today.
